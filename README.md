# Contemporary Dance Choreography
Experimenting with generating choreography with code

## Introduction
In the summers at my studio, I often take a choreography composition class.  In the first sessions, the instructor typically asks each participant to share any goals they might have for their choreography.  This year, my interest is in finding interesting and new (to me) combinations of movements, like pirouette and move directly to a floor sequence.  How would I do this?  I could watch videos and try things I see, but that doesn't feel authentic to the process I had in mind.  I could write out all the possible steps on papers and draw them randomly out of a hat, but that's not really random because mixing them up wouldn't work that well.  Then I thought, it would be statistically more sound to have a computer generate the list of steps.  So that's what this is.  I'm starting with a simple draw from the pool of steps
